# CVIP-Email_spam_detection
In this code, we create a simple dataset with email text . We then split the dataset into training and testing sets, convert the email text into numerical features using the CountVectorizer, and train a Naive Bayes classifier. Finally, we evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and a classification report.  In a real-world scenario.
